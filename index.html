            <p class="para">Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). <br>
                 Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. <br>
                  A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

        <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. <br>
            Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. <br>
            Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. <br>
            There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. <br>
            Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. <br>
             Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.

        <p>Debra Howcraft and John Carroll proposed a methodology in which web development process can be divided into sequential steps. They mentioned different aspects of analysis.
        Phase one involves crafting a web strategy and analyzing how a website can effectively achieve its goals. <br>
        Keil et al.'s research identifies the primary reasons for software project failures as a lack of top management commitment and misunderstandings of system requirements. <br>
        To mitigate these risks, Phase One establishes strategic goals and objectives, designing a system to fulfill them. <br>
        The decision to establish a web presence should ideally align with the organization's corporate information strategy.</p>
